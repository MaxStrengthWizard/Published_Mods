	<content contentuid="h37758f4fg1b02g4dfbg9550g2055a6be3292" version="1">Bane is the Faerunian god of hatred, fear, and tyranny. He rules from his dread plane of Banehold, working through his paladins, clerics, and other agents to gather as much power as they can under The Black Hand's banner. Bane's ultimate goal is to crush the weak through remoreseless conquest and achieve total domination of all Faerûn.</content>

	<content contentuid="h667b7fcag535dg49deg95abg70d237a6eb70" version="1">Bhaal is the notorious and feared Lord of Murder, the Faerûnian god of violence and ritualistic killing. His worshipers are assassins that deliberately kill not only to please him, but as a sacred act to honour their god and deepen Bhaal's influence on the world. Bhaal was slain during the Time of Troubles and lost most of his divinity but had spread his heritage and sadistic impulses through all of Faerûn prior to a horrific ritual resurrection.</content>
